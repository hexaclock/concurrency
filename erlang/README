Assignment #5

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

To the TA or grader -

   You can compile and run our submission with the following:
   "erlc sensor.erl watcher.erl; erl +P 262144 -noshell -s watcher main" - this should work with at least 100,000 processes.
   **Press Ctrl+C to abort as the assignment implies this system should never stop on its own**
